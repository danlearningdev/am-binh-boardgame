# Âm Binh – Vietnamese Spirit-Themed Strategy Card Game

**Âm Binh** is a strategy card game inspired by the mystical spiritual beliefs of Vietnam. Developed by a multidisciplinary student team at RMIT, the game lets players take on the role of shadowy shamans battling not only ancient spirits, but also one another — where greed, wrath, and delusion turn allies into rivals.

## 🧙 About the Game

In a haunted village deep in the forest, dark forces once sealed away have been unleashed. As **Pháp Sư Âm Binh** (Spirit Shamans), players must use captured souls, talismans, and dark magic to exorcise evil — all while confronting each other in a treacherous battle for dominance.

The game blends dark fantasy with Vietnamese folk motifs, featuring stylized animated art, spiritual symbolism, and moral tension where every decision comes at a cost.
